                    Our signals are based on combination of several factors: technical analysis, event-based approach and experience in timing
                    the market. It should not be seen as a financial advice and is solely speculative. Before committing
                    to a position do your own research and choose your preferred option.

                <br>
                <p>
                    Our signals are delivered via a invitation only Slack group. There is a (i) community chat-room, where we collectively discuss
                    about the market and share related information, (ii) a requests channel and (iii) a main signal channel,
                    where our recommendation will be delivered.

                    We aim to provide 3-5 signals daily with buy and sell targets. However, it depends on the overall market conditions, which
                    means that sometimes the best thing to do is not to trade at all, but observe the market and prepare
                    for the upcoming day.

        any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed
        by the European Union laws and you hereby consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in European Union

        that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including, without limitation, this section. You agree
        that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Crypto Cubed as a result
        of this agreement or use of the Site. Crypto Cubed's performance of this agreement is subject to existing laws and
        legal process, and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of Crypto Cubed's right to comply with governmental,
        court and law enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of the Site or information provided to or
        gathered by Crypto Cubed with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable
        pursuant to applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set
        forth above, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision
        that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the agreement shall continue
        in effect. Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the user and
        Crypto Cubed with respect to the Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals,
        whether electronic, oral or written, between the user and Crypto Cubed with respect to the Site. A printed version
        of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form shall be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings
        based upon or relating to this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business
        documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. It is the express wish to the parties
        that this agreement and all related documents be written in English.

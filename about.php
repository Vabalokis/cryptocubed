<h1>CRYPTO CUBED</h1>
<p>
  We aspire to become a one-stop-shop for those who are participating in the cryptocurrency market. Not everyone can become a full-time trader, which makes it a bit more difficult to succeed on a daily basis. It is a vibrant 24/7 market where information asymmetry is still prevalent. Therefore, we want to reduce that gap and provide timely information and capitalize on the market inefficiency. In addition, we aim to educate the community by providing access to the Knowledge Base, where material such the 11 Commandments of Trading, how to apply and interpret technical analysis and other relevant market-moving information will be uploaded on a regular basis.
</p>

<h1>WHAT IS OUR GOAL?</h1>
<p>
The crypto market is not easy. It is only in the early stages of mainstream adoption. There is only limited investor protection in this marketplace and confidence is based purely on expectations and trust. Unlike in traditional financial markets, the intraday volatility of cryptocurrencies can become overwhelming and shake off weak hands at the worst possible time. For example, the >50% decrease in total market capitalization in September, 2017 and a similar situation in the beginning of 2018. Such events are supposed to be viewed as a window of opportunity, but as we observe, it instead inflicts panic and leads to enormous losses. Our goal is to minimize risk and educate you to be able to read and comprehend the market, provide positions with strong potential, capitalize on the dynamics of the market and how to interpret the market fundamentals.
